# TinyML-Based Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring Using PPG Signals

## Abstract
This study presents a novel approach to continuous, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring using Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and TinyML. We developed and deployed a lightweight neural network model on an ESP32 microcontroller interfaced with a MAX30102 sensor, achieving clinical-grade accuracy while maintaining minimal computational and memory requirements. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of implementing continuous blood pressure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.
