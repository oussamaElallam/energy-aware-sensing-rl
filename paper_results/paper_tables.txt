=== TABLE 3 FOOTNOTE ===
†Statistical significance (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n=10 runs): 
RL vs. Always-on: p < 0.002 for both detection and energy
RL vs. Periodic: p < 0.002 for both detection and energy  
95% CI for RL (λ=0): detection [48.6%, 51.5%], energy [109.7, 117.8] mAh

=== TABLE 5: Policy Robustness ===
λ     | Detection(%) | Energy(mAh) | Savings(%)
------|--------------|-------------|------------
0     | 50.1 ± 2.0   | 113.8 ± 5.7 | 54.5
20    | 49.6 ± 1.8   | 112.6 ± 5.5 | 55.0
200   | 49.7 ± 1.7   | 112.8 ± 5.6 | 54.9

=== BATTERY CALCULATION FOOTNOTE ===
Assuming 500mAh battery: Always-on: 250mAh/16h = 15.625mA average → 500/15.625 = 32 hours. 
RL (λ=0): 113.8mAh/16h = 7.11mA → 500/7.11 = 70.3 hours (2.2× improvement).
